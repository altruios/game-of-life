the game of life is john Conway's most well known discovery/invention.
the rules are simple:
//rules 1 if you are alive, and have 2 or 3 neighbors, stay alive
//rule 2 if you are alive, and next to less than 2, die.
//rule 3 if you are alive and next to more than 3, die.
//rule 4 if you are dead and next to exactly 3, become alive.

this was generated using javascript and some php.
vanilla javascript.

the shapes were parsed from:
